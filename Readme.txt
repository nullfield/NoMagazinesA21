This is a tiny overhaul mod for 7 Days to Die v1.0. It reverts the magazine mechanic and restores the perks and schematic system. There are no resources or graphics added.
The mod consists entirely of xpath edits and an Localization.txt file. As it makes changes to the crafting system, most other mods for V1.0 that add craftable items to the game are likely to be incompatible with it.
